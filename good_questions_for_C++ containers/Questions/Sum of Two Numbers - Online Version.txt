Implement a data structure with the following methods:

add(int val) adds the value val to the data structure
find(int val) returns whether there are two numbers whose sum equals to val
Constraints

n ≤ 10,000 where n is the number of times add will be called
m ≤ 1,000 where m is the number of times find will be called
Example 1
Input

methods = ["constructor", "add", "find", "add", "find"]
arguments = [[], [5], [10], [6], [11]]
Output

[null, null, false, null, true]
Explanation

We create a TwoSum first
Then we add the number 5 to the data structure
We check if there's two numbers whose sum is 10. There isn't, so we return false
Then we add the number 6 to the data structure
We check if there's two numbers whose sum is 11, which there is since 5 + 6 = 11.
