Given a binary search tree root containing unique values, and an integer t, return the value of the inorder successor of t. That is, return the smallest value greater than t in the tree.

Note: you can assume that the inorder successor exists.

For example, given this root, and t = 2

   5
  / \
 2   8
    / \
   6   9
Return 5.

Bonus: can you do it in O(h) space where h is the height of the tree?

Example 1
Input

root = [2, [0, null, [1, null, null]], [3, null, [4, null, null]]]
t = 2
Output

3
