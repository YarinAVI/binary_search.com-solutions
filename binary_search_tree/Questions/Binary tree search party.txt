Given the root to a binary search tree and an integer val, determine whether val is in the tree.

For example, given the following binary search tree:

   3
  / \
 2   9
    / \
   7   12
  / \
 4   8
and val = 4, return true since it's in the tree. If val = 10, return false since it's not in the tree.
