You are given a binary tree root with each node containing single digits from 0 to 9. Each path from the root to the leaf represents a number with its digits in order.

Return the sum of numbers represented by all paths in the tree.

For example, given the following tree:

   3
  / \
 5   2
    / \
   1   4
we have the following numbers represented by paths:

35 (3 → 5)
321 (3 → 2 → 1)
324 (3 → 2 → 4)
and their sum is 680.
