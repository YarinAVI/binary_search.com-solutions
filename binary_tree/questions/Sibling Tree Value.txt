You are given an integer k and a binary search tree root, where each node is either a leaf or contains 2 children.

Find the node containing the value k, and return its sibling's value.

For example, given the tree:

   5
  / \
 1   8
    / \
   6   9
and k = 1 return 8. Given k = 9, return 6.

You can assume that the answer always exists (e.x. root won't have value of k)

Example 1
Input

root = [2, [1, null, null], [3, null, null]]
k = 1
Output

3
