Given the root to a binary tree, return the largest sum of any path that goes from the root to a leaf.

For example, given the tree:

   1
  / \
 5   4
    / \
   7   12
  / \
 4   8
Return 20, since the path with the largest sum is 1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8.

Note: Nodes can have negative values.

Input

root = [1, [5, null, null], [4, [7, [4, null, null], [8, null, null]], [12, null, null]]]
Output
