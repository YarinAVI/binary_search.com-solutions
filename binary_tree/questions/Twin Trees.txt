Given two binary trees, root0 and root1, return whether their structure and values are equal.

For example, these two trees are equal.

   0         0
  / \       / \
 5   9     5   9
These two are not since their values are different.

   0         1
  / \       / \
 5   9     9   5
These two are not since their structure is different:

   0         0
  / \       / \
 5   9     5   9
  \
   3
Example 1
Input

root0 = [-75, null, null]
root1 = [-75, null, null]
Output

true
Explanation

These two trees have the same values and same structure.
