Given a binary tree, prune the tree so that subtrees containing all 0s are removed.

For example, given the following tree:

   0
  / \
 5   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 0   0
should be pruned to:

   0
  / \
 5   0
    /
   1
We do not remove the tree at the root or its left child because it still has a 1 as a descendant.

Example 1
Input

root = [0, [1, null, null], [0, [1, [0, null, null], [0, null, null]], [0, null, null]]]
Output

[0, [1, null, null], [0, [1, null, null], null]]
